# Code for the April 2024 edition of "Practical Artificial Intelligence With Java"

The new 2024 edition is largely a rewrite of older material with the addition of new material (mostly Large Language Models)

[Leanpub Link for latest edition](https://leanpub.com/javaai)

This book is a combination of

- new coverage of LLMs
- new coverage of deep learning
- new material: creating and using knowledge graphs
- examples from my discontinued book "Power Java": anomaly detection, linked data, using DBPedia, OpenNLP, and web scraping
- examples from the original editions of this book: genetic algorithms and search algorithms 
- a few examples updated from my discontinued book "Practical Semantic Web and Linked Data Applications, Java Edition"
