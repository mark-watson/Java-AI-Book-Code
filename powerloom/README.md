## License

Since 2005, PowerLoom® is available free-of-charge under a triple disjunctive open-source licensing scheme that allows you to pick the Mozilla Public License v. 1.1 (MPL), the GNU General Public License v. 2.0 (GPL) or the the GNU Lesser Public License v. 2.1 (LGPL) to fit your needs. This scheme is similar to what's used for the Mozilla web browser and should give people maximum flexibility to use PowerLoom even for commercial development while still retaining the advantages of open-source licensing.
